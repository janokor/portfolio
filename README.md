IN my corpus I want to focus on comparing two genres - nu jazz and trip hop. I want to compare two things which are not too different from each other, I think this will be far more interesting. I think these two genres give me similar vibes, while using different sounds tempos and voices. These two genre also blend a lot of other similar genres such ass funk, soul and EDM. As a comarison I will be using two most popular playlist that represent the genres (based on the amount of likes. I think these will be the most representtive which is represented by the thousands of poeple who found liked them. 
I am still trying ot figure out which variables to compare with this two genres. I believe that valence, accousticness, instrumentalness are the most interestig variables to compare in this case but I want to take time to experiment with the R and see what works best for me.
