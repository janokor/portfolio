I am still not sure what my corpus will look like. I am nut sure if i want to compare to similar genres, focus more on comparing two artist or albums of the same artist from different years. I don't want to choose a topic too soon and then work on something that doesn't interest me that much. 
I want to compare two things which are not too different from each other, I think this will be far more interesting. 
When comparing two artist I would probably take the "This is ..." playlist created by Spotify. I don't find them very accurate most of the times, but I know that a lot of poeple use them when discvering new artist which shows that they are quite influencial.
